                        <div class="food-introduction-content">The country’s great staple dish is Pho (pronounced “fuh”). This noodle soup can be eaten at any time of day but is primarily eaten at breakfast. It originated in the north of the country but is now a national dish of Vietnam. A bowl of Pho consists of a light beef or chicken broth flavoured with ginger and coriander, to which are added broad, flat rice noodles and spring onions. Meat-wise, slivers of chicken, pork or beef are then added. Tofu is the main vegetarian option. </div>

                        <div class="food-introduction-content">Goi Cuon are translucent spring rolls packed with greens, coriander and minced pork or shrimp. A southern variation has barbecued strips of pork wrapped up with green banana and star fruit, and then dunked in a rich peanut sauce – every bit as tasty as it sounds.

                            Served cold, Goi Cuon are usually served as a starter before a main course at Vietnamese restaurants. If you travel to northern Vietnam then you may find that they're referred to as Nem Cuon. Whatever they're called, they're certainly delicious! </div>

                        <div class="food-introduction-content">Banh mi is one of the most popular street foods in Vietnam – and once you've read what goes into it, you'll be desperate to try it out for yourself! The Vietnamese (or Saigon) sandwich was first created during French colonial rule during the 19th century. Banh mi uses a French baguette and is filled with a delicious selection of ingredients.

                            The baguette sandwich is filled with greens and a choice of fillings, including paté and usually pork. Other fillings include beef, chicken, liver and tofu. Banh mi is so good that it's gone on to be imitated around the world, from London to New York. </div>

                        <div class="food-introduction-content">Bun Cha is a Hanoi specialty. You’ll find bun cha at food stalls and street kitchens across the city. The pork is barbecued on an open charcoal brazier and served on a bed of cold rice noodles with assorted foliage and a broth.
                            This type of Vietnamese cuisine is usually eaten at lunchtime. It's been described as somewhat similar to meatballs or hamburgers, but we think that with its intriguing mix of flavours, there's not another taste like it!  </div>

                        <div class="food-introduction-content">Com Tam is a quick’n’easy street-stand favourite that is almost exclusive to Ho Chi Minh City. Made up of smaller pieces of rice, it's also known as Broken Rice, and was traditionally a leftover-style snack. The Vietnamese have managed to hone it into a renowned Ho Chi Minh street food snack.
                            Com Tam is served with either grilled/steamed/shredded pork (usually grilled), fish or simply a fried egg. And this being Vietnam food, it wouldn’t be complete without a squeeze of lime, a sprinkle of fresh herbs and a smattering of spring onion. </div>

                            The best city to try Banh xeo (or "sizzling pancake") is Ho Chi Minh City . But it's also one of those snacks that you should stock up on if you're travelling by train or bus – the perfect accompaniment for those long journeys. </div>
